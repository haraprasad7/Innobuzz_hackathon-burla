contains arduino code, python com port reading code, web page codes(html, css, php) and word file with images on hardware progress
this project uses pyzoelectric device for the detection of elephant and the location of the detect elephant is sent to the forest dept. through
rf module 
  -transmitter sends the code
  -reciever revieves the code
the the location code is decoded to its correspomdimg location and the data is sent to the railway depertment for further action.

main components
  -arduino mega(nano or uno can be used)
  -rf reciever and transmitter module
  -8 ohm speaker
  -buzzer
  -battery
  -rellay
  -sound module
  -memory card
  -wires
  
  the threshold is calculated and the program to calculate threshold is also uploaded.
